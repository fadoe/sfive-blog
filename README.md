# Sfive Blog

This is a fork of the [Serendipity](http://s9y.org) weblog application. This is application is not for production use.
You can't use this version for upgrading from a existing Serendipity Blog. I refactor this application to use current
PHP libraries mainly based on Zend Framework.

If you need a blogging engine for PHP use the stable version of [Serendipity](https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/releases).
